<BOS> From the beginning of my life I have been looking for your face but today I have seen it  Today I have seen the charm, the beauty, the unfathomable grace of the face that I was looking for  Today I have found you and those who laughed and scorned me yesterday are sorry that they were not looking as I did  I am bewildered by the magnificence of your beauty and wish to see you with a hundred eyes  My heart has burned with passion and has searched forever for this wondrous beauty that I now behold  I am ashamed to call this love human and afraid of God to call it divine  Your fragrant breath like the morning breeze has come to the stillness of the garden You have breathed new life into me I have become your sunshine and also your shadow  My soul is screaming in ecstacy Every fiber of my being is in love with you  Your efflugence has lit a fire in my heart for me the earth and sky  My arrow of love has arrived at the target I am in the house of mercy and my heart is a place of prayer <EOS>
<BOS> I am a sculptor, a molder of form.  In every moment I shape an idol.  But then, in front of you, I melt them down  I can rouse a hundred forms  and fill them with spirit,  but when I look into your face,  I want to throw them in the fire.  My souls spills into yours and is blended.  Because my soul has absorbed your fragrance,  I cherish it.  Every drop of blood I spill  informs the earth,  I merge with my Beloved  when I participate in love.  In this house of mud and water,  my heart has fallen to ruins.  Enter this house, my Love, or let me leave. <EOS>
<BOS> how long can i lament with this depressed heart and soul  how long can i remain a sad autumn ever since my grief has shed my leaves  the entire space of my soul is burning in agony  how long can i hide the flames wanting to rise out of this fire  how long can one suffer the pain of hatred of another human a friend behaving like an enemy  with a broken heart how much more can i take the message from body to soul  i believe in love i swear by love believe me my love  how long like a prisoner of grief can i beg for mercy  you know i’m not a piece of rock or steel but hearing my story even water will become as tense as a stone  if i can only recount the story of my life right out of my body flames will grow <EOS>
<BOS> It is the rule with drunkards to fall upon each other, to quarrel, become violent, and make a scene. The lover is even worse than a drunkard. I will tell you what love is: to enter a mine of gold. And what is that gold?  The lover is a king above all kings, unafraid of death, not at all interested in a golden crown. The dervish has a pearl concealed under his patched cloak. Why should he go begging door to door?  Last night that moon came along, drunk, dropping clothes in the street. “Get up,” I told my heart, “Give the soul a glass of wine. The moment has come to join the nightingale in the garden, to taste sugar with the soul-parrot.”  I have fallen, with my heart shattered – where else but on your path? And I broke your bowl, drunk, my idol, so drunk, don’t let me be harmed, take my hand.  A new rule, a new law has been born: break all the glasses and fall toward the glassblower. <EOS>
<BOS> Don’t go anywhere without me. Let nothing happen in the sky apart from me, or on the ground, in this world or that world, without my being in its happening. Vision, see nothing I don’t see. Language, say nothing. The way the night knows itself with the moon, be that with me. Be the rose nearest to the thorn that I am.  I want to feel myself in you when you taste food, in the arc of your mallet when you work, when you visit friends, when you go up on the roof by yourself at night.  There’s nothing worse than to walk out along the street without you. I don’t know where I’m going. You’re the road, and the knower of roads, more than maps, more than love. <EOS>
<BOS> Turn me like a waterwheel turning a millstone. Plenty of water, a Living River. Keep me in one place and scatter the love. Leaf-moves in wind, straw drawn toward amber, all parts of the world are in love, but they do not tell their secrets. Cows grazing on a sacramental table, ants whispering in Solomon’s ear. Mountains mumbling an echo. Sky, calm. If the sun were not in love, he would have no brightness, the side of the hill no grass on it. The ocean would come to rest somewhere.  Be a lover as they are, that you come to know you Beloved. Be faithful that you may know Faith. The other parts of the universe did not accept the next responsibility of love as you can. They were afraid they might make a mistake with it, the inspired knowing that springs from being in love <EOS>
<BOS> Tonight is a night of union for the stars and of scattering, scattering, since a bride is coming from the skies, consisting of a full moon. Venus cannot contain herself for charming melodies, like the nightingale which becomes intoxicated with the rose in spring-time. See how the polestar is ogling Leo; behold what dust Pisces is stirring up drom the deep! Jupiter has galloped his steed against ancient Saturn, saying “Take back your youth and go, bring good tidings!” Mars’ hand, which was full of blood from the handle of his sword, has become as life-giving as the sun, the exalted in works. Since Aquarius has come full of that water of life, the dry cluster of Virgo is raining pearls from him. The Pleiades full of goodness fears not Libra and being broken; how should Aries flee away in fright from its mother? When from the moon the arrow of a glance struck the heart of Sagittarius, he took to night-faring in passion for her, like Scorpio. On such a festival, go, sacrifice Taurus, else you are crooked of gait in the mud like Cancer. This sky is the astrolabe, and the reality is Love; whatever wesay of this, attend to the meaning. Shamsi-Tabriz, on that dawn when you shine, the dark night is transformed to bright day by your moonlike face. <EOS>
<BOS> From these depths depart towards heaven; may your soul be happy, journey joyfully. You have escaped from the city full of fear and trembling; happily become a resident of the Abode of Security4 . If the body’s image has gone, await the image-maker; if the body is utterly ruined, become all soul. If your face has become saffron pale through death, become a dweller among tulip beds and Judas trees. If the doors of repose have been barred to you, come, depart by way of the roof and the ladder. If you are alone from Friends and companions, by the help of God become a saheb-qeran5 [lord of happy circumstance]. If you have been secluded from water and bread, like bread become the food of the souls, and so become! <EOS>
<BOS> When the rose is gone and the garden faded you will no longer hear the nightingale’s song. The Beloved is all; the lover just a veil. The Beloved is living; the lover a dead thing. If love withholds its strengthening care, the lover is left like a bird without care, the lover is left like a bird without wings. How will I be awake and aware if the light of the Beloved is absent? Love wills that this Word be brought forth. <EOS>
<BOS> All through eternity  Beauty unveils His exquisite form  in the solitude of nothingness;  He holds a mirror to His Face  and beholds His own beauty.  he is the knower and the known,  the seer and the seen;  No eye but His own  has ever looked upon this Universe.  His every quality finds an expression:  Eternity becomes the verdant field of Time and Space;  Love, the life-giving garden of this world.  Every branch and leaf and fruit  Reveals an aspect of His perfection-  They cypress give hint of His majesty,  The rose gives tidings of His beauty.  Whenever Beauty looks,  Love is also there;  Whenever beauty shows a rosy cheek  Love lights Her fire from that flame.  When beauty dwells in the dark folds of night  Love comes and finds a heart  entangled in tresses.  Beauty and Love are as body and soul.  Beauty is the mine, Love is the diamond.  They have together  since the beginning of time-  Side by side, step by step.  I swear, since seeing Your face,  the whole world is fraud and fantasy  The garden is bewildered as to what is leaf  or blossom. The distracted birds  can’t distinguish the birdseed from the snare.  A house of love with no limits,  a presence more beautiful than venus or the moon,  a beauty whose image fills the mirror of the heart. <EOS>
<BOS> Love is the Water of Life  Everything other than love for the most beautiful God  though it be sugar- eating.  What is agony of the spirit?  To advance toward death without seizing  hold of the Water of Life. <EOS>
