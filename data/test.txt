<BOS> Should Love’s heart rejoice unless I burn? For my heart is Love’s dwelling. If You will burn Your house, burn it, Love! Who will say, ‘It’s not allowed’? Burn this house thoroughly! The lover’s house improves with fire. From now on I will make burning my aim, From now on I will make burning my aim, for I am like the candle: burning only makes me brighter. Abandon sleep tonight; traverse fro one night the region of the sleepless. Look upon these lovers who have become distraught and like moths have died in union with the One Beloved. Look upon this ship of God’s creatures and see how it is sunk in Love. <EOS>
<BOS> A moment of happiness,  you and I sitting on the verandah,  apparently two, but one in soul, you and I.  We feel the flowing water of life here,  you and I, with the garden’s beauty  and the birds singing.  The stars will be watching us,  and we will show them  what it is to be a thin crescent moon.  You and I unselfed, will be together,  indifferent to idle speculation, you and I.  The parrots of heaven will be cracking sugar  as we laugh together, you and I.  In one form upon this earth,  and in another form in a timeless sweet land. <EOS>
<BOS> HOW SHOULD THE SOUL not take wings when from the Glory of God It hears a sweet, kindly call: “Why are you here, soul? Arise!” How should a fish not leap fast into the sea form dry land When from the ocean so cool the sound of the waves reaches its How should the falcon not fly back to his king from the hunt When from the falconer’s drum it hears to call: “Oh, come back”? Why should not every Sufi begin to dance atom-like Around the Sun of duration that saves from impermanence? What graciousness and what beauty? What life-bestowing! What grace! If anyone does without that, woe- what err, what suffering! Oh fly , of fly, O my soul-bird, fly to your primordial home! You have escaped from the cage now- your wings are spread in the air. Oh travel from brackish water now to the fountain of life! Return from the place of the sandals now to the high seat of souls! Go on! Go on! we are going, and we are coming, O soul, From this world of separation to union, a world beyond worlds! How long shall we here in the dust-world like children fill our skirts With earth and with stones without value, with broken shards without worth? Let’s take our hand from the dust grove, let’s fly to the heavens’ high, Let’s fly from our childish behaviour and join the banquet of men! Call out, O soul, to proclaim now that you are rules and king! You have the grace of the answer, you know the question as well! <EOS>
<BOS> Oh Beloved, take me. Liberate my soul. Fill me with your love and release me from the two worlds. If I set my heart on anything but you let fire burn me from inside.  Oh Beloved, take away what I want. Take away what I do. Take away what I need. Take away everything that takes me from you. <EOS>
<BOS> The lover’s food is the love of the bread; no bread need be at hand: no one who is sincere in his love is a slave to existence.  Lovers have nothing to do with with with existence; lovers have the interest without the capital.  Without wings they fly around the world; without hands they carry the polo ball off the field.  That dervish who caught the scent of Reality used to weave basket even though his hand had been cut off.  Lover have pitched their tents in nonexistence: they are of one quality and one essence, as nonexistence is. <EOS>
<BOS> rocking and rolling what have you been drinking please let me know  you must be drunk going house to house wandering from street to street  who have you been with who have you kissed who’s face have you been fondling  you are my soul you are my life i swear my life and love is yours  so tell me the truth where is that fountainhead the one you’ve been drinking from  don’t hide this secret lead me to the source fill my jug over and over again  last night i finally caught your attention in the crowd it was your image filling my dream  telling me to stop this wandering stop this search for good and evil  i said my dear prophet give me some of that you’ve drunk for ecstasy of life  if i let you drink you said any of this burning flame it will scorch your mouth and throat  your portion has been given already by heaven ask for more at your peril  i lamented and begged i desire much more please show me the source  i have no fear to burn my mouth and throat i’m ready to drink every flame and more <EOS>
